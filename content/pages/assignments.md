There will be weekly homework sets. Homework solutions will be handed out on the day that the homework is due. Late homeworks will be heavily discounted. The lowest homework score will be dropped.Â 

You may interact with fellow students when preparing your homework solutions. However, you must write up solutions on your own. Duplicating a solution that someone else has written or providing solutions to be copied is not acceptable. If you do collaborate on homework, you must cite, in your written solution, your collaborators.
